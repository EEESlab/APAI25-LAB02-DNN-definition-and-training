# APAI-LAB02: DNN-definition and training

## Material

Assigment: [here](./docs/assignment.docx)
Slides: [here](./docs/slides.pdf)

## Summary

Today we will work using a well-known environment for python, that is Jupyter Notebook. Using such tool, we will see how to define and train a simple DNN, using PyTorch. Guidelines to work on today's assignment: 

1. Clone this repository in you local Docker using <git clone https://github.com/EEESlab/APAI25-LAB02-DNN-definition-and-training >
2. Read the [slides]() and follow the [assignment](./docs/assignment.docx)
3. Complete the code in the [Jupyter notebook](./APAI25-LAB2-DNN-definition-and-training.ipynb)


## How to deliver the assignment:

Use Virtuale, upload only the assignment file named as follows: LAB#_APAI_yourname.ipynb

**Assignment DEADLINE: 17/10/2025 (at 14:30)**

## Quickstart

### How to set the environment (Your PC)

1. Open a terminal
2. Go into 'APAI-Docker' folder.
3. Open VSCode with 'code .'
4. On VSCode, click on 'Reopen in container'.
5. Open you new terminal in VSCode and launch the following commands to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/EEESlab/APAI25-LAB02-DNN-definition-and-training 
cd APAI25-LAB02-DNN-definition-and-training/
```
5. Now you're ready to start!

### How to set the environment (LAB1)
